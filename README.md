### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome to my profile!

I am a 4th year CS student at OSU-Cascades, graduating in Spring 2023. This account contains most of my school projects and assignments, including my current project, the [Smart Recyling Bin Capstone Project](https://github.com/jakeengstrom3/SmartRecyclingBin_Capstone).
